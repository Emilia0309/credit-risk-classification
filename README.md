# credit-risk-classification

Overview

In this challenge, we will use various techniques to train and evaluate a machine learning model that classifies loan risk. Using a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company, we aim to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. Specifically, we will predict whether a loan is low-risk (healthy loan) or high-risk (at risk of default). This project will guide you through the process of building and evaluating a model that helps in identifying the credit risk of loans.
